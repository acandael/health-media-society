      <p>Joyce Stroobant earned a Master’s degree in Advanced Linguistics from Ghent University specialising in transitivity and the relation between language and extra-linguistic reality</p>
      <p>Her PhD, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Karin Raeymaeckers, will focus on sourcing practices; particularly, Joyce will conduct a large-scale, quantitative content analysis to determine which elderly-related health issues, actors and sources are present in Flemish news media.</p>
      <p>Complementary to this quantitative dimension, she will also develop a more qualitatively oriented frame and discourse analysis based on a subset of the data collected for the content analysis to explore in detail the identified discursive clusters on news that are specifically dealing with elderly-related health issues.</p>
