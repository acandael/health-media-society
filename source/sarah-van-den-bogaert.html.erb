    <p>Sarah Van den Bogaert graduated in 2012 as a sociologist at the University of Ghent.</p>
    <p>For her master thesis she interviewed elderly about income and loneliness. She also obtained a master’s degree in health prevention and promotion. From October 2013 until September 2014, she has worked as a research assistant at the Research Group TOR of the Free University of Brussels.</p>
    <p>Sarah is currently preparing a PhD under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Piet Bracke. The aim is first to chart the political-economic and institutional relations between the different stakeholders that are active in the broad field of elderly-related health issues in Flanders and secondly, to explore the discourses on elderly-related health problems as articulated by these various interest groups in order to investigate and assess their active contribution to the construction of health news.</p>
