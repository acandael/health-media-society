        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>Drawing on a transdisciplinary partnership between communication sciences, sociolinguistics, medical science and sociology, Health, Media &amp; Society looks at how the news media cover elderly-related health issues. Applying a holistic or start-to-end approach, we investigate the different interconnected stakeholders that are involved in the ‘chain’ of health news discourses: the pharmaceutical industry; policy-making bodies; health insurance companies; special-interest groups (health consumer organizations; patient support and advocacy organizations; academic research and expert groups; and associations of health professionals); the news media (traditional and online); and the general public.</p>

        <h2>Consortium</h2>
        <p>A holistic, start-to-end approach to the way health issues are dealt with in the news media is ambitious and multi-faceted, and it requires a so-called transdisciplinary perspective. Therefore, the Health, Media &amp; Society group brings together for the first time the complementary expertise of leading Ghent University research centres in the areas of communication science and journalism, media discourse analysis, health sociology and health communication and, likewise, it will consider the achievements from the different perspectives of the disciplines that we represent. </p>
